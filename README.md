# environment-calculator
# Inspiration
We wanted to make an impact in our world to create a healthy environmental life with our code

# What it does
It detects the number of trees from an aerial image and uses it to calculate the approximate amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide amount in the region. This helps to determine the air quality index of the surrounding neighborhood

# How we built it
We processed the image using opencv and detected contours of the trees to find the number of trees and their size. This is used to make an approximate oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and the collected data is represented as a pie chart

# Built With
Python, openCV
